GitTestBench.txt

This repository is all about a safe and easy to understand repository where a developer can learn and try new commands and concepts in "git" without the concern of doing any damage on a 'real' code repository.

If you are learning a new command that might have grave consequences if you make mistakes clone this repo and add a feature branch and play to your hearts content
